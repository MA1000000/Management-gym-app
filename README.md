Building a Gym Management UI Application with User Login System using Python, Kivy, KivyMD, CSV, Pandas, and DateTime


Introduction:

In this project, I developed a Gym Management UI application using Python, Kivy, KivyMD, CSV, Pandas, and DateTime. The objective was to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows users to log in, sign up, manage their account information, schedule meetings/classes, and access relevant contact information. The application features eight screens, including login, sign-in, main, my account, my meetings, add meetings, contact screen, and edit my account.

Technologies Used:

Python: The programming language used for the project.

Kivy: A Python framework for developing multi-touch applications.

KivyMD: A Material Design extension for Kivy, providing additional UI components.

CSV: A file format used for storing data in a tabular form.

Pandas: A data manipulation library used for efficient data handling.

DateTime: A Python module used for managing date and time-related operations.





Features Implemented:

User Login System: Users can log in using their credentials, which are authenticated against stored user information.

User Sign-up: New users can create an account by providing necessary information such as username, password, and contact details.

My Account: Users can view and edit their account details, including personal information and contact details.

My Meetings: Users can view their scheduled meetings or classes, along with relevant details such as date, time, and instructor.

Add Meetings: Users can schedule new meetings or classes by providing the necessary information, such as date, time, and instructor.

Contact Screen: Users can access contact information for gym staff or instructors for any inquiries or assistance.

Edit My Account: Users can modify their account information, such as updating their contact details or changing their password.
